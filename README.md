# Testing Resources

Curated by [Rachel Kibler](https://racheljoi.com) — Senior Quality Engineer, international keynote speaker, and Agile Testing Fellowship trainer.

This is the list I actually use and recommend to testers at all career stages. It skews toward context-driven, exploratory, and holistic approaches to testing rather than scripted or certification-focused material.

Pull requests welcome — see [contributing notes](#contributing) below.

## Contributing

If you have a resource to suggest, open a PR with:
- The link
- A one-sentence description of what it is
- Why you think it belongs here (what problem does it solve for testers?)

I'm looking for resources that help testers think critically, work collaboratively, and build craft — not just tool tutorials or certification prep material.

## About This List

This list reflects my philosophy about testing: it's a thinking discipline, not just a checklist discipline. You'll find more resources here about exploratory testing, context-driven approaches, and collaboration than you will about test case management tools or certification exam prep.

If that's not your style, that's fine — but this list probably isn't for you.
